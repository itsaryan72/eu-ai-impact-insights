A data-driven exploration of the EU AI Act, its risk classifications, and AI readiness across EU nations.

Introduction

The **EU AI Act** is the European Union's first attempt to regulate Artificial Intelligence in a structured and risk-based way. As AI rapidly integrates into healthcare, transportation, law enforcement, and finance, the EU is taking steps to ensure it's used **ethically, transparently, and safely**.

This act classifies AI systems into **four risk categories**: 
- **Unacceptable Risk**
- **High Risk**
- **Limited Risk**
- **Minimal Risk**

Our project aims to explore:
- How AI is being adopted across different EU countries
- Which sectors and applications face the most scrutiny
- How prepared each country is to handle these regulations

Through data analysis and visualization, weâ€™ll uncover which industries and nations may be most impacted â€” and provide insights for future readiness.



To analyze the impact of the EU AI Act, consider the following datasets:
1. Risk Classification Database by appliedAI Institute
Description: An open and free database providing practical examples of high-risk and non-high-risk AI use cases under the EU AI Act.
Access: Risk Classification Database

2. EU AI Act Risk Categories Summary
Description: Detailed explanations of the risk categories defined in the EU AI Act, including Unacceptable Risk, High Risk, and Limited or Minimal Risk.
Access: Understanding EU AI Act Risk Categories

3. EU AI Act Official Documentation
Description: The official text of the EU AI Act, providing comprehensive information on the regulation's provisions.
Access: EU AI Act Official Text

ðŸ§¾ How Is the Data Structured?
The datasets typically include the following fields:
Use Case: Description of the AI application.
Risk Category: Classification under the EU AI Act (e.g., High Risk, Limited Risk).
Sector: Industry sector where the AI application is used (e.g., Healthcare, Finance).
Compliance Requirements: Specific obligations for the AI application under the EU AI Act.
Country: EU member state where the AI application is deployed (if applicable).

ðŸ“Š Completed Visualizations:
Risk Class Distribution â€“ overall view of high vs. low-risk systems.
Risk Class by Enterprise Function â€“ shows how risk varies across business areas.
Applicable Annex Breakdown â€“ reveals which annex is most commonly cited.
Annex vs. Risk Class â€“ insight into the regulatory depth vs. AI system risk.
Enterprise Function Adoption â€“ highlights which sectors are using AI the most.
