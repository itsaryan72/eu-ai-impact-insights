# EU AI Impact Insights
A data-driven exploration of the EU AI Act, its risk classifications, and AI readiness across EU nations.


## 🧠 **Introduction**

The EU AI Act is the European Union's first major attempt to regulate Artificial Intelligence through a structured, risk-based approach. As AI rapidly integrates into critical sectors like healthcare, transportation, law enforcement, and finance, the EU aims to ensure AI is used ethically, transparently, and safely.


## 🧱 Risk Categories

AI systems are classified into four risk levels under the EU AI Act:

1. Unacceptable Risk
2.  High Risk
3. Limited Risk
4. Minimal Risk


## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project explores:

1. AI adoption across EU countries
2. Sectors and use cases under regulatory scrutiny
3. EU nations’ preparedness for AI compliance

Using data analysis and visualizations, we uncover trends in AI use, assess regulatory impact, and generate insights to prepare for the future.


## 📂 Datasets Used
To analyze the impact of the EU AI Act, we leveraged:

1. Risk Classification Database – by appliedAI Institute
   
   - 🗂️ A database of practical examples of high-risk and non-high-risk AI use cases.

2. EU AI Act Risk Categories Summary
   
   - 📋 Detailed definitions and examples for each risk category.

3. EU AI Act Official Documentation
   
   - 🏛️ Official EU legislation explaining the provisions of the Act.


## 📊 How Is the Data Structured?
The datasets typically contain:

- Use Case: Short description of the AI system
- Risk Category: Unacceptable, High, Limited, or Minimal
- Sector: Domain or industry (e.g., Finance, Healthcare)
- Compliance Requirements: Regulatory obligations per use case
- Country: Where the AI system is deployed


## 📈 Completed Visualizations
1. Risk Class Distribution – Overview of high- vs. low-risk systems
2. Risk Class by Enterprise Function – Risk levels across business areas
3. Applicable Annex Breakdown – Which annexes are most cited
4. Annex vs. Risk Class – Relationship between annexes and system risk
5. Enterprise Function Adoption – AI usage by sector


## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world AI applications in the EU and classifies them by risk level, as defined by the EU AI Act. By examining enterprise functions, sectors, and compliance rules, we assess the regulatory impact and readiness of EU nations.

## ✨ Key Features
-  Data Cleaning – Handled missing values and ensured clean, usable data
  
-  Visualization – Created impactful plots to display risk distributions
  
-  Insights – Revealed trends in risk allocation across sectors and annexes
